Description:

For our final webware project we decided to create a website to 
buy party hats for what ever occasion you needed it for. The 
main page starts with the search bar at the top where users 
can search through the list of party hat names that are 
available. Below that is a home page button and a cart button. 
The cart button will take you to the checkout page to purchase 
whatever hats you have added to your personal cart. If you switch 
tabs and open the website there you will see the same cart that 
you have on the other page but once you get off the website your 
cart will be cleared since you had no interest in buy those hats. 
On the checkout page there are buttons to remove and hats you 
have added to your cart that you decided you don't want anymore. 
Then underneath all the hats in your cart is a button to purchase 
your whole cart. The user will be prompted if they are sure they 
want to buy the hats after pressing that button and afterward 
they will be redirected to the home page. Underneath the cart 
button on the homepage is the featured products banner. Whenever 
the home page is updated there will be three different and random 
hats. The only acception is the illuminati hat, if that is 
selected as a featured product then all the featured products are 
illuminati hats and a creepy sound plays over the website. 
Underneath the featured products banner is the list of all the 
hats available in alphabetic order. When you hover over each hat 
item it will flash with bright colors as if there is a party going 
on behind the item. If the user clicks the hat item the will be 
sent to the corresponding hat product page where they will see 
the image, the full name, the description, the features, and the 
price of the hat. There is also a logo on the top of the product 
page that will redirect the user back to the home page. Underneath 
the hat price there is a purchase button that will add the hat into 
your cart and redirect you the checkout. The user can then go 
back to the home page by pressing the logo and buy as many more 
hats as they want.

Technical Achievements:

-	The website hosts all the hats as a file system of hat folders 
with their respective data in each folder. That way if the owner 
of the website wants to add more hats they do not have to code 
it in. They simply need to make a new folder and modify the hat 
data file for that folder.

-	The website arranges the hats in alphabetic order for the home 
	page and the search page.

-	The websites styling is very fun and inviting for the user to 
	click around and see.

-	Audio tags are used for easter eggs in the illuminati page, 
	the rick astley page, and when the illuminati is chosen for the 
	featured products banner.

-	The cart stays consistend during a browser session.

-	The user can remove a hat from the cart or add multiples of the 
	same hat to the cart if they wish.

-	Templates are used all around to make styling the content easier.

-	We make sure to confirm the purchase before submitting it into 
	the system.
